In order to keep getting Dependabot updates, please merge this PR and migrate to GitHub-native Dependabot before then._\n\nDependabot has been fully integrated into GitHub, so you no longer have to install and manage a separate app. This pull request migrates your configuration from Dependabot.com to a config file, using the [new syntax][new_syntax]. When merged, we'll swap out `dependabot-preview` (me) for a new `dependabot` app, and you'll be all set!\n\nWith this change, you'll now use the [Dependabot page in GitHub][dependabot_page], rather than the [Dependabot dashboard][dashboard], to monitor your version updates, and you'll configure Dependabot through the new config file rather than a UI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you've got any questions or feedback for us, please let us know by creating an issue in the [dependabot/dependabot-core][issues] repository.\n\n[Learn more about migrating to GitHub-native Dependabot][learn]\n\nPlease note that regular `@dependabot` commands do not work on this pull request.\n\n[dashboard]: https://app.dependabot.com/\n[dependabot_page]: https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/credhub/network/updates\n[issues]: https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/new?assignees=%40dependabot%2Fpreview-migration-reviewers\u0026labels=E%3A+preview-migration\u0026template=migration-issue.md\n[learn]: http://docs.github.com/code-security/supply-chain-security/upgrading-from-dependabotcom-to-github-native-dependabot\n[new_syntax]: https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates\n[org_secrets_url]: https://github.com/organizations/cloudfoundry-incubator/settings/secrets/dependabot\n[repo_secrets_url]: https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/credhub/settings/secrets/dependabot\n",

We do this to grab\n\u003e feedback and communicate early to our users the kind of changes we're intending\n\u003e to ship with bundler 3. See\n\u003e [#6965](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/bundler/bundler/pull/6965).\n\u003e \n\u003e Another important improvement is a better coexistence between bundler\n\u003e installations and the default copy of bundler that comes with ruby installed as\n\u003e a default gem. Since bundler is shipped as a default gem with ruby, a number of\n\u003e users have been affected by issues where bundler ends up failing due to version\n\u003e mismatches, because at some point of the execution, bundler switches to run the\n\u003e default copy instead of the expected version. A number of PRs have been focused\n\u003e on minimizing (hopefully eliminating) this, such as\n\u003e [#7100](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/bundler/bundler/pull/7100),\n\u003e [#7137](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/bundler/bundler/pull/7137),\n\u003e [#6996](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/bundler/bundler/pull/6996),\n\u003e [#7056](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/bundler/bundler/pull/7056),\n\u003e [#7062](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/bundler/bundler/pull/7062),\n\u003e [#7193](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/bundler/bundler/pull/7193),\n\u003e [#7216](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/bundler/bundler/pull/7216),\n\u003e [#7274](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/bundler/bundler/pull/7274)\n\u003e \n\u003e Deprecations:\n\u003e \n\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003c/table\u003e ...
